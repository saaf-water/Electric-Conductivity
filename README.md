# Electric-Conductivity
Code for Electric Conductivity Probe, checks on presence of particles (like salt) in water based on that gives value of Electric Conductivity. 
Also added provision for Temperature Sensor for better results, because activity of salt changes with change in temperature and thereby affect 
Electric Conductivity.
